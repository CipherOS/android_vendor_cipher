    <!-- A collection of defaults for the quick affordances on the lock screen. Each item must be a
    string with two parts: the ID of the slot and the comma-delimited list of affordance IDs,
    separated by a colon ':' character. For example: <item>bottom_end:home,wallet</item>. The
    default is displayed by System UI as long as the user hasn't made a different choice for that
    slot. If the user did make a choice, even if the choice is the "None" option, the default is
    ignored. -->
